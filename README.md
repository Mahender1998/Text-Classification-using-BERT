# Text-Classification-using-BERT
In this model i have used Transfer Learning technique to classify ham and spam emails .
I used a famous pretrained model BERT or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers 
for feature extraction and then added few more fully connected layers to fine tune.
